Trying to learn how to script messy page
This was for the following page http://www.cec.org.al/Portals/0/Documents/CEC%202013/zgjedhje-per-kuvend/2017/zaz_qv/170324_-_DTI_-_QV_zgjedhes/report1+(2)/90.htm  
I am new to scrapping and it took me a while to figure out how to extract the individual elements since they are not, at least to me when doing it, very well separated in the source code.
I brought everything together at the end in a messy way which could be written in a much more concise way, probably iterating through the columns with list comprehension and fusing in the loop instead of working with each list separately.
